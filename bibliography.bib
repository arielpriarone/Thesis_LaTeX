ABSTRACT = {With the exponential growth of science, Internet of Things (IoT) innovation, and expanding significance in renewable energy, Smart Grid has become an advanced innovative thought universally as a solution for the power demand increase around the world. The smart grid is the most practical trend of effective transmission of present-day power assets. The paper aims to survey the present literature concerning predictive maintenance and different types of faults that could be detected within the smart grid. Four databases (Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science) were searched between 2012 and 2020. Sixty-five (n = 65) were chosen based on specified exclusion and inclusion criteria. Fifty-seven percent (n = 37/65) of the studies analyzed the issues from predictive maintenance perspectives, while about 18% (n = 12/65) focused on factors-related review studies on the smart grid and about 15% (n = 10/65) focused on factors related to the experimental study. The remaining 9% (n = 6/65) concentrated on fields related to the challenges and benefits of the study. The significance of predictive maintenance has been developing over time in connection with Industry 4.0 revolution. The paper’s fundamental commitment is the outline and overview of faults in the smart grid such as fault location and detection. Therefore, advanced methods of applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can enhance and improve the reliability and resilience of smart grid systems. For future direction, we aim to supply a deep understanding of Smart meters to detect or monitor faults in the smart grid as it is the primary IoT sensor in an AMI.},

abstract = {Nowadays in industry there is a great and increasing demand in resource management, taking into consideration the ever-growing complexity of technical systems. The concept of maintenance is one the most important topics of product development today. As the factories and the industry evolves, the need of proper maintenance plays a major factor in cost and efficiency optimization. In this paper a state of the art of maintenance techniques is presented, predictive maintenance being one of the biggest topics going forward. Predictive maintenance techniques are discussed and presented in detail creating the necessary links with nowadays industry advances: Industry 4.0.}

ABSTRACT = {New technologies are developed inside today&rsquo;s companies with the ascent of Industry 4.0 paradigm; Artificial Intelligence applied to Predictive Maintenance is one of these, helping factories automate their systems in detecting anomalies. The deviation of statistical features from standard operating conditions computed on collected data is a common investigation technique that companies use. The information loss due to transformation from raw data to extracted features is a problem of this approach. Furthermore, a common Predictive Maintenance framework requires historical data about failures that often do not exist, neglecting the possibility of applying it. This paper uses Artificial Intelligence as Machine Learning models to recognize when something changes in the data&rsquo;s behavior collected up to that moment, also helping companies to gather a preliminary dataset for future Predictive Maintenance implementation. The aim concerns a framework in which several sensors are used to collect data by adopting a sensor fusion approach. The architecture is composed of an optimized software system able to enhance the computation scalability and the response time regarding novelty detection. This article analyzes the proposed architecture, then explains a proof-of-concept development using a digital model; finally, two real cases are studied to show how the framework behaves in a real environment. The analysis done in this paper has an application-oriented approach; hence a company can directly use the framework in its systems.},
